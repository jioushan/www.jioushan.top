Emotional problems continue over time. Let's talk about the theory this time.

Whether the server is used for website construction or storage. (A win-win is all right.) (However, too much content on one server is a problem with the load.)

Cloudflare's workers came to access Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive for a while, and everyone deployed it that way. However, cf's server is well known to everyone. (This kind of station has stability as its own private network disk, but the bandwidth quality is known to be uncomfortable.)

In fact, it is not impossible to embed cf services. You can use a machine that is very fast for domestic and overseas (Hong Kong) visits. (CN2, Azure, Amazon machines are all available.) Use this machine to reverse the IP of cloud flare. The domestic three networks can analyze and take away your machine too Hong Kong.

But then again, as a personal webmaster/user. In the case of having a domestic machine/ICP Filing domain name, it is most appropriate to choose a domestic service.

Both the quality of access and the feeling of use are superior.

What buckets are worth trying (domestic and foreign.)

(Still, catch up with Tencent Cloud's recent activity.) Cheap tried a wave of COS (actually the same thing as the S3 bucket.
