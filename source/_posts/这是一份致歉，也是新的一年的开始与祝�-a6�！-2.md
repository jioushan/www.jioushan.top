Write an apology here@[itsneko!](https://nekodeng.gitee.io/) Because of my negligence, I didn't realize it was more than a month later. I didn't see your message. Probably something happened to the sending system. I didn't receive a few messages at the time in my mailbox, and I'm sorry here. I will definitely take good note of it in the future to avoid this mistake.

In addition, the new year also asks bloggers to work harder. My blessing is late. (Although I could also tamper with the time to make it out in advance.) But I have to take responsibility for my mistakes.

Set up a flag in advance, I may be able to cut down on food and clothing (reduce maintenance costs)[https://jioushan.xyz](https://jioushan.xyz) this rice is going to be unaffordable for me. (Due in June) I'm sorry. Please please change the station to [https://msr.pub](https://msr.pub) Thank you! After a while I will post this year's announcement of my website maintenance migration. Reissue a few articles written last year but didn't send out, they lie in my keep. Because I wrote it down, I probably didn't sort it out well. What was missed in the second half of last year still has to be made up.
