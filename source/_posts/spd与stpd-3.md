## **SPD**

## **_Schizoid_** personality disorder:

**\*** SPD is short for schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorder, STPD.

Introverted indifference, away from crowds, faceless. But unlike true schizophrenia, there are no hallucinations and delusions. Therefore, it is impossible to diagnose schizophrenia.

Introverted and indifferent, far from crowds, expressionless (emotionally cold), usually immersed in their own world, unresponsive to praise or derogation, unable to accept the real world. But unlike true schizophrenia, there are no hallucinations and delusions. Therefore, it is impossible to diagnose schizophrenia. Neither want nor enjoy intimate relationships, no interest in sex.

This type of person is mainly characterized by a lack of gentle and soft feelings for others; not caring about other people's criticism or encouragement of him, not caring about how others feel about him, only a very small number of close friends, sometimes only with family, almost no friends, no socialization, showing social obstacles, in the eyes of others, appear cold, lonely, and arrogant and detached. Try to avoid things that move emotionally, and maintain an indifferent attitude, so it can be called a lonely personality abnormality.

People with this type of personality can adapt in a lonely working environment, but in places with many people, they are not suitable at all.

## **STPD**

## Schizo**_typal_** personality**disorder**

Delusional, pathological thoughts and strange behavior, and lack of communication skills, very similar to schizophrenia, only mildly ill to be diagnosed as schizophrenia. Ideas of reference, which feels like everything is relevant to him. ）

People with this type of personality abnormality, showing a variety of strange thinking, perception, speech, or behavior, although not schizophrenic, but the family with such personality abnormalities often suffer from chronic schizophrenia, there may be genetic relationships, so it is called schizophrenic personality abnormality.

The main characteristics of this type of person are to express magical thinking, superstition, strange fantasies, or ideas; to think that there are special perceptual abilities such as the sixth sense; to talk a little strange, abstract, and mysterious; to have less intimate relationships with people, and are often called strange people, strange people, etc.

### **Schizophrenic personality disorder** **(STPD).**

**Schizophrenic personality disorder** **(STPD)**or [Schizophrenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) **disorder** is a mental disorder [characterized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) by severe [social anxiety,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety) mental [disorders,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder) paranoid ideas, [illusion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization) transient [psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis) and the usual unconventional beliefs. People with the disease felt extremely uncomfortable in maintaining intimate relationships with people and avoiding relationships with them, mainly because subjects believed that their peers had negative thoughts about them. Strange speech and mannerisms and strange dress patterns are also symptoms of this disease. People with STPD may react strangely in conversations instead of responding or speaking to themselves. [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Schacter-1)They often interpret the situation as strange or unusual to them. Beliefs in the [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal) and superstitious are common. These people often seek treatment for anxiety or depression, rather than [personality disorders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-DSM_5-2)Schizophrenic personality disorder makes up about 3% of the general population and is more common in men.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-pulay-3)

The term "schizophrenic type" was first coined by [Sandor Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandor_Rado) in 1956 as an abbreviation for "schizophrenia [_phenotype"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) _._ [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Millon_11-4)STPD is classified as a [Category A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_A) personality disorder characterized by "bizarre or bizarre disorders."

**\*** SPDs are included within STPD. But there is a clear difference between the two. (If you can't understand it well, please select the Zhihu link comment jump.) [Click here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/36661423)

One obvious difference is that

### Complications\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=2)\]

Schizophrenic personality disorder often occurs simultaneously with [major depressive disorder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia) [disorder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) and widespread [social phobia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_phobia) [\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Adams_99-5)In addition, sometimes schizophrenic personality disorder may occur simultaneously with [obsessive-compulsive disorder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder) and its presence seems to adversely affect the outcome of treatment. [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Murray-6)The most common personality disorders associated with [schizophrenia are schizophrenia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) [paranoia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder) [avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder) and [junctionality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Tasman-7)

There is schizotypal personality disorder. Some people develop [schizophrenia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) [\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-8) but most don't. [\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-9)Although longitudinal studies of STPD symptoms have been conducted in many community samples, the results received do not indicate any significant possibility of developing schizophrenia. [\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-10)Dozens of studies have shown that on a wide range of neuropsychological tests, people with schizophrenic personality disorder score similarly to those with schizophrenia. [Cognitive deficits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit) in patients with schizophrenic personality disorder are very similar to those in [patients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit) with schizophrenia, but in numbers less than in patients with schizophrenia. [\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-11)However, a 2004 study reported neurological evidence that "does not fully support that SPD is just a form of attenuation of schizophrenia."[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Haznedar_2004-12)

If [methamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) is used, people with schizotypal personality disorder are highly likely to develop permanent [psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis) .[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-13)

## Reason\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=3)\]

### heredity\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=4)\]

Schizophrenic personality disorder is widely understood as a ["schizophrenia spectrum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_approach#Psychosis) disorder. The incidence of schizophrenic personality disorder is higher among relatives of schizophrenic patients than in people with other mental illnesses or relatives without psychosis. Technically, schizophrenic personality disorder can also be considered an ["extended phenotype"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_phenotype) that helps geneticists track the familial or genetic transmission of genes associated with [schizophrenia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) [\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-14)However, STPD is also genetically linked to mood disorders and depression.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Comer-15)

### Social and environmental\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=5)\]

There is now evidence that [parenting styles of parents,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles) early separation, and a history of trauma/abuse (especially neglect in early childhood) can lead to the development of schizophrenia characteristics. [\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-16) [\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-17)Neglect or abuse in childhood, trauma, or family dysfunction may increase the risk of developing schizophrenic personality disorder. Over time, children learn to understand social cues and respond appropriately, but for unknown reasons, the process doesn't work well for people with the disease.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Schizotypal_personality_disorder-18)

Schizophrenic personality disorder is characterized by varying degrees of common attention disorders that can serve as a marker of biological sensitivity to STPD. [\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Roitman-19)The reason is that individuals who have difficulty accessing information may find difficulties in complex social environments where interpersonal cues and attentive communication are essential for high-quality interactions. This may eventually lead to the withdrawal of individuals from most social interactions, leading to [asociality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociality)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Roitman-19)

## Diagnosis\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=6)\]

### DSM-5\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=7)\]

In the [American Psychiatric Association's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association) [DSM-5,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) schizophrenic personality disorder is defined as "a universal pattern of social and interpersonal deficits characterized by acute discomfort and decreased capacity in intimate relationships, as well as cognitive or perceptual distortion and eccentricity." Behavior, beginning in early adulthood, occurs in a variety of situations. ”[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-DSM_5-2)

At least five of the following symptoms must occur:

*   [Reference ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideas_of_reference_and_delusions_of_reference)
*   Strange beliefs or [magic thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking)
*   Abnormal perceptual experience
*   Strange thoughts and words
*   paranoia
*   Inappropriate or restricted
*   Strange behavior or appearance
*   Lack of close friends
*   Excessive social anxiety does not abate, but stems from paranoia, not a negative judgment of the self.

These symptoms must not occur only during a disorder with similar symptoms, such as schizophrenia or [autism spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) disorder.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-DSM_5-2)

### ICD-10\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=8)\]

The [world health organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) of [ICD-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10) uses the name _Schizotypal Disorder_ [(F21).](http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F21) It is classified as a clinical disorder associated with [schizophrenia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) rather than [a personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) such as [DSM-5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) [\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-who.int-20)

The definition of icd is: this disorder is characterized by abnormalities in mental behavior and thinking and emotion, similar to schizophrenia, although no definitive characteristic schizophrenia occurs at any stage. There is no major or typical interference, but any of the following may be present:

*   Inappropriate or narrow [effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)) (the individual appears indifferent and detached);
*   Weird, weird, weird or weird behavior or appearance;
*   Poor relationships with others, tendency to socially withdraw;
*   Peculiar beliefs or [magical thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) that influence behavior and do not conform to [subcultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcultural) norms;
*   Suspicious or paranoid thoughts;
*   Obsessed [with contemplation,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumination_(psychology)) without inner resistance;
*   Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily sensations (physical) or other hallucinations, [depersonalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization) or [de-realityization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization) ;
*   vague, indirect, metaphorical, over-elaborated or stereotyped thinking, manifested in strange words or otherwise, without obvious incoherence;
*   Occasional transient quasi-psychotic episodes with intense hallucinations, auditory or other hallucinations and delusional thoughts, usually occur without external provocation.

This disease has a chronic process of fluctuating intensity. Sometimes it can evolve into overt schizophrenia. There is no clear onset, and its evolution and process is usually a personality disorder. It is more common in individuals associated with people with schizophrenia and is thought to be part of the genetic "spectrum" of schizophrenia.

#### Diagnostic guidelines\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=9)\]

This diagnostic column is not recommended for general use, as it is not clearly distinguished from simple schizophrenia, schizophrenia or paranoid personality disorder or currently diagnosed [autism spectrum disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder) If the term is used, the three or four typical features listed above should be continuously or popularly present for at least 2 years. Individuals must not meet the criteria of schizophrenia itself. A history of schizophrenia in first-degree relatives is of additional importance to the diagnosis, but is not a prerequisite.

##### include\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=10)\]

*   Borderline schizophrenia
*   Underlying schizophrenic response
*   Prepsychotic schizophrenia
*   Prodromal schizophrenia
*   [Pseudo-neurotic schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoneurotic_schizophrenia)
*   Pseudopsychotic schizophrenia
*   Schizotypal personality disorder

##### exclude\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=11)\]

*   [Schizophrenic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder)
*   [Autism spectrum disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder)

### Subtype\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=12)\]

[Theodore Millon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Millon) proposed two subtypes of schizophrenia. [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Millon_11-4) [\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-21)Anyone with schizotypal personality disorder may exhibit one of the following slightly different _subtypes (note_ that Millon believes that having a pure variant of personality is rare, but a hybrid minor variant of a primary variant with one or more variants):

Subtype

Describe

Personality traits

**Bland split type**

The structure of the passive separation mode is exaggerated. It includes [schizophrenia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_personality_disorder) and [dependence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_personality_disorder)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_personality_disorder)

Feelings of strangeness and non-existence; overly monotonous, sluggish, and lacking in expressiveness; internal blandness, barrenness, apathy and insensitivity; vague, fuzzy and tangential thoughts.

**Early split type**

Structural exaggeration of active separation patterns. It includes [avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder) and [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_personality_disorder) traits.

Cautious, vigilant, suspicious, vigilant, constantly shrinking, causing excessive sensitivity to be lost; alienating oneself from oneself and others; deliberately preventing, reversing, or canceling one's own thoughts.

### Differential diagnosis\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=13)\]

The incidence of [comorbidities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity) with other personality disorders is high. McGlashan et al. (2000) states that this may be due to the overlap of criteria with other personality disorders, such as [avoidant personality disorder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder) [paranoid personality disorder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder) and [borderline personality disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-22)

There are many similarities between [schizophrenia and schizophrenia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid) The most obvious similarities are the inability to establish or maintain relationships (friendly and romantic). The difference between the two seems to be that those labeled as schizophrenic avoid social interactions because of deep-seated fears about people. People with schizophrenia simply don't want to build relationships because they don't think it makes sense to share time with others.

Both [simple schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple-type_schizophrenia) and STPD can share [negative symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom#Positive_and_negative) like [unmotivated,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avolition) impoverished thinking and flat effects. Although they look similar, the severity can often distinguish them. Similarly, STPD is characterized by a lifelong pattern that does not change much, while simple schizophrenia manifests itself as worsening.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-23)

## Treatment\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=14)\]

### drugs\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=15)\]

STPD is rarely seen as the main cause of treatment in a clinical setting, but it often coexists with other psychiatric disorders. When patients with STPD use prescription drugs, it is common to use the same drugs as those used to treat patients with [schizophrenia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) including traditional antipsychotics such as [haloperidol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloperidol) and thiophene [thiophene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiothixene) . To decide which drug should be used, Paul Markovitz distinguished between two types of schizophrenia:[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Livesley_01-24)

*   The beliefs and behaviors (abnormal perception and cognition) of patients with schizophrenia seem to be almost schizophrenia, usually receiving treatment with low doses of [antipsychotic drugs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) such as [thiothiosephene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiothixene) . However, it must be mentioned that the long-term efficacy of neuroleptics is unclear.
*   For people with schizophrenia, their beliefs and behaviors are more compulsive — [SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) like [sertraline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline) seem to be more effective.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline)

[Lamotrigine,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine) an [anticonvulsant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-convulsant) , appears to help cope with social isolation.\[ _[需要引用](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_ \]

### Treatment\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=16)\]

According [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Millon)to[Theodore Millon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Millon)schizophrenia is one of the easiest personality disorders to identify, but it is also one of the most difficult to treat with psychotherapy. [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Millon_11-4)People with STPD usually see themselves as just eccentric, productive, or out-of-the-box people. Often, they underestimate their poor adaptive abilities for social isolation and perceptual distortions. It's not easy to stay on good terms with people with STPD, because the truth is that increasing familiarity and intimacy often increases their anxiety and discomfort levels. For the most part, they don't react to informality and humor.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-25)

Group therapy is recommended only if patients with STPD are well structured and supportive. Failure to do so may result in loose ideas and tangentials. [\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Livesley_01-24)Support is especially important for schizophrenic patients with major [paranoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia) symptoms, as they experience a lot of difficulties even in highly structured populations.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-Oldham_1-26)

## epidemiology\[ [编辑](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizotypal_personality_disorder&action=edit&section=17)\]

The prevalence of STPD reported in community studies ranged from 0.6% in the [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) sample to 4.6% in the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) sample. [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-DSM_5-2)A large U.S. study found a lifetime prevalence of 3.9 percent, with men (4.2 percent) outperforming women (3.7 percent). [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-pulay-3)May not be common in the clinical population, with reported rates ranging from 0% to 1.9%.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-DSM_5-2)

According to a 2008 New York study, along with other [Group A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder#Personality_clusters) personality disorders, [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness) in [open-sleep centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness) is also common. The study did not target homeless people who did not show up at the shelter.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-27)

#### A [Colorado Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Colorado_Springs) study comparing personality disorders with [the Myers-Briggs type index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) type found that the disease had been associated with introversion (I), intuition (N), thinking (T), and perception (P) preferences.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder#cite_note-28)
